Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you! You came to us with 
stomach pain and worsening distension. While you were here we 
did a paracentesis to remove 1.5L of fluid from your belly. We 
also placed you on you 40 mg of Lasix and 50 mg of Aldactone to 
help you urinate the excess fluid still in your belly. As we 
discussed, everyone has a different dose of lasix required to 
make them urinate and it's likely that you weren't taking a high 
enough dose. Please take these medications daily to keep excess 
fluid off and eat a low salt diet. You will follow up with Dr. 
___ in liver clinic and from there have your colonoscopy 
and EGD scheduled. Of course, we are always here if you need us. 
We wish you all the best!
Your ___ Team.

# Goals of care:  The patient expressed that her desire to ""let 
go"" and be at peace. She is tired of ""fighting"" her end stage 
liver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of 
life. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice, 
which we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would 
like to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the 
patient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably 
be DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP). 
Therefore, at this time, she remains full code. We also 
discussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter 
placed because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged 
to home with hospice on ___.

# Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient 
presented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed 
with tramadol and morphine. She underwent ___ paracentesis 
on ___ with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies 
on the fluid were negative, and she reported a significant 
improvement in her pain.
 
# Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization, it was noted that 
she had hyperkalemia 5.3 -> 5.9 -> 6.9 without EKG changes. 
After treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2, insulin and D50 x 
2, and kayexelate, her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been 
persistently elevated in the past and should continue to be 
monitored.

# Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status was A+Ox3 
on admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose 
in-house and at discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============

# Hyponatremia - The patient has a history of asymptomatic 
hyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia 
related to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis 
dysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic 
through her hospitalization. Because she was also started on 
10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re-accumulation, she 
will require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting.

# HIV: Emtricitabine-Tenofovir (Truvada) and Raltegravir were 
continued in-house and at discharge.  

# COPD: fluticasone, tiotropium and albuterol were continued 
in-house and at discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[ ] Follow-up peritoneal fluid culture
[ ] New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily (new)
[ ] For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, the patient should have 
biweekly BMPs (script written). If K > 5.3, she should be given 
kayexelate once weekly. Lab results will be faxed/sent to Dr. 
___.
[ ] Continue conversation regarding pleurex catheter placement 
and code status.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at ___. You 
were admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely 
that this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from 
your cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid 
was removed, your pain improved significantly. You were noted to 
have a high potassium during your hospitalization, which came 
down with treatment but this should continue to be followed as 
an outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a 
representative from hospice. Because of your repeated 
paracenteses, we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex 
catheter placement. We arranged for you to meet with hospice 
coordinators, and you will be discharged home with hospice.

We wish you all the best!

History of Present Illness:
___ male with ___ disease, dyslipidemia, and a
history of prostate cancer (s/p prostatectomy) who was referred
to the ED by his neurologist for worsening gait, falls, and
visual hallucinations. 

The following history is taken from chart review: 

The patient was seen by his neurologist on ___ at which time he
was noted to have visual hallucinations and worsening gait
freezing. For his gait freezing, his mirapex was increased by
0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He
successfully up-titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but
began to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on ___ his
neurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID. 
Despite
the changes to his Mirapex, the patient's daughter has noted
progressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing.
This has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the
bathroom leading to episodes of incontinence. A UA performed on
___ was reassuring. 

On the day of presentation to the hospital, the patient began to
experience visual hallucinations of a motor cross race in his
backyard. He subsequently had a fall while transferring from the
couch to a chair. His wife was unable to get him off the floor.
The fall was witnessed and there was no head strike. Per the
patient's wife, his gait has acutely worsened over the past 24
hours to the point where he has been unable to ambulate on his
own. The patient's daughter called his neurologist who
recommended presentation to the ED. 

In the ED, the patient was afebrile, HRs ___, normotensive, and
SpO2 100% RA. On exam he was noted to have cogwheeling of upper
extremities and decrease ___ strength. Labs were remarkable for a
negative urine and serum tox, Na 132, K 5.8 (hemolyzed and no 
EKG
changes), negative troponin, normal LFTs, unremarkable CBC. 
Chest
Xray showed no acute process and CTH was reassuring. He was
evaluated by neurology who recommended admission to medicine for
failure to thrive, to continue the patient's home medications,
and complete a toxo-metabolic workup. The patient was given his
home pramipexole and pravastatin before he was admitted.  

On arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable in bed. He 
is
not accompanied by family on my interview. He knows that he is 
in
the hospital and that it is ___. He is not sure why he is here
and begins to tell me about a party in his house with a motor
cross race in his backyard. When I asked him about his fall, he
mentions that he has not had a fall for ___ years. He denies any
fevers, chills, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea,
diarrhea, or dysuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Urology after undergoing laparoscopic 
right radical nephrectomy. No concerning intraoperative events 
occurred; please see dictated operative note for details. The 
patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The 
patient was transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable 
condition.  On POD0, pain was well controlled on PCA, hydrated 
for urine output >30cc/hour, provided with pneumoboots and 
incentive spirometry for prophylaxis, and ambulated once. On 
POD1,foley was removed without difficulty, basic metabolic panel 
and complete blood count were checked, pain control was 
transitioned from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was advanced to a 
clears/toast and crackers diet. On POD2, diet was advanced as 
tolerated. The remainder of the hospital course was relatively 
unremarkable. The patient was discharged in stable condition, 
eating well, ambulating independently, voiding without 
difficulty, and with pain control on oral analgesics. On exam, 
incision was clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of 
hematoma collection or infection. The patient was given explicit 
instructions to follow-up in clinic with ___ in 3 weeks.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is an ___ with history of AAA s/p repair 
complicated by MI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presents 
upon transfer from outside hospital with nasal fractures and 
epistaxis secondary to fall. The patient reports that he was at 
the ___ earlier this afternoon. While coughing, he tripped 
on the curb and suffered trauma to his face. He had no loss of 
consciousness. However, he had a persistent nosebleed and 
appeared to have some trauma to his face, thus was transferred 
to ___ for further care. There, a CT scan of 
the head, neck, and face were remarkable for a nasal bone and 
septal fracture. Given persistent epistaxis, bilateral 
RhinoRockets were placed. He had a small abrasion to the bridge 
of his nose which was not closed. Bleeding was well controlled. 
While in the OSH ED, he had an episode of nausea and coughed up 
some blood. At that time, he began to feel lightheaded and was 
noted to be hypotensive and bradycardic. Per report, he had a 
brief loss of consciousness, though quickly returned to his 
baseline. His family noted that his eyes rolled back into his 
head. The patient recalls the event and denies post-event 
confusion. He had no further episodes of syncope or hemodynamic 
changes.  Given the syncopal event and epistaxis, the patient 
was transferred for further care.

In the ED, initial vital signs 98.9 92 140/77 18 100%/RA. Labs 
were notable for WBC 11.3 (91%N), H/H 14.1/40.2, plt 147, BUN/Cr 
36/1.5. HCTs were repeated which were stable. A urinalysis was 
negative. A CXR demonstrated a focal consolidation at the left 
lung base, possibly representing aspiration or developing 
pneumonia. The patient was given Tdap, amoxicillin-clavulanate 
for antibiotic prophylaxis, ondansetron, 500cc NS, and 
metoprolol tartrate 50mg. Clopidogrel was held.

IMAGING:
___ CXR
PA and lateral views of the chest provided. The lungs are 
adequately 
aerated. There is a focal consolidation at the left lung base 
adjacent to the lateral hemidiaphragm. There is mild vascular 
engorgement. There is bilateral apical pleural thickening. The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is remarkable for aortic arch 
calcifications. The heart is top normal in size. 

___ ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal apical 
hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 
%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There 
are three aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild 
regional systolic dysfunction most c/w CAD (distal LAD 
distribution). Mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic 
regurgitation. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ with history of AAA s/p repair 
complicated by MI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who 
presented with nasal fractures and epistaxis after mechanical 
fall with hospital course complicated by NSTEMI.

#Epistaxis, nasal fractures
Patient presenting after mechanical fall with Rhinorockets 
placed at outside hospital for ongoing epistaxis. CT scan from 
that hospital demonstrated nasal bone and septal fractures. The 
Rhinorockets were maintained while inpatient and discontinued 
prior to discharge. He was encouraged to use oxymetolazone nasal 
spray and hold pressure should bleeding reoccur. 

#NSTEMI
Patient found to have mild elevation of troponin in the ED. This 
was trended and eventually rose to 1.5, though MB component 
downtrended during course of admission. The patient was without 
chest pain or other cardiac symptoms. Cardiology was consulted 
who thought that this was most likely secondary to demand 
ischemia (type II MI) secondary to his fall. An echocardiogram 
demonstrated aortic stenosis and likely distal LAD disease based 
on wall motion abnormalities. The patient's metoprolol was 
uptitrated, his pravastatin was converted to atorvastatin, his 
clopidogrel was maintained, and he was started on aspirin.

#Hypoxemia/L basilar consolidation
Patient reported to be mildly hypoxic in the ED, though he 
maintained normal oxygen saturations on room air. He denied 
shortness of breath or cough, fevers, or other infectious 
symptoms and had no leukocytosis. A CXR revealed consolidation 
in left lung, thought to be possibly related to aspirated blood. 
-monitor O2 saturation, temperature, trend WBC. He was convered 
with antibiotics while inpatient as he required prophylaxis for 
the Rhinorockets, but this was discontinued upon discharge.

#Acute kidney injury
Patient presented with creatinine of 1.5 with last creatinine at 
PCP 1.8. Patient was unaware of a history of kidney disease. The 
patient was discharged with a stable creatinine.

#Peripheral vascular disease
Patient had a history of AAA repair in ___ without history of 
MI per PCP. Patient denied history of CABG or cardiac/peripheral 
stents. A cardiac regimen was continued, as above.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
-Outpatient stress echo for futher evaluation distal LAD disease 
(possibly a large myocardial territory at risk). 
-Repeat echocardiogram in ___ years to monitor mild AS/AR.
-If epistaxis returns, can use oxymetolazone nasal spray.
-Repeat chest x-ray in ___ weeks to ensure resolution of the LLL 
infiltrative process.
-Consider follow-up with ENT or Plastic Surgery for later 
evaluation of nasal fractures.
-Repeat CBC in one week to ensure stability of HCT and 
platelets.
-Consider conversion of metoprolol tartrate to succinate for 
ease-of-administration.

Imaging
___ US abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION: 
1. Diffusely echogenic liver, suggestive of fatty infiltration. 
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease 
including fibrosis and cirrhosis cannot be excluded. 
2. Layering sludge within the gallbladder, with mild gallbladder 
wall 
thickening, which may relate to underlying liver disease.  
3. Patent portal venous system. 
4. Moderate ascites. 
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 


CT abd/pelvis ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Large volume ascites and enlarged edematous liver. The 
findings are 
suggestive of acute hepatitis.  
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

ECHO ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral and tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic 
function. No diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension or 
pathologic valvular disease seen.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ woman with history of EtOH ___ years, 
heavy at times, with new onset liver failure and ascites.  
  
#  ASCITES/LFTs:  New onset ascites with SAAG supportive of 
portal hypertension.  Likely alcoholic hepatitis with ascites 
and possibility of cirrhosis.  Steroids and pentoxyphyline were 
deferred given her low discriminate factor.  In terms of other 
etiologies of liver disease, iron panel was not consistent with 
hemochromatosis, and ___, AMA, ___ were negative, making 
autoimmune causes unlikely.  Alpha 1 antitrypsin and 
ceruloplasmin were normal.  Viral studies show immunity to Hep B 
and A.  HIV was negative.  U/S and CT abd/pelvis were not 
suggestive of mass or obstructive lesions.  Patient received a 
2.5L paracentesis on ___, day prior to discharge.  Low-dose 
spironolactone was started.  Ms. ___ will follow-up with 
Dr. ___ in 1 week.
  
#  ALCOHOLISM:  On admission, alcohol level was 336 though 
patient was clinically sober.  Patient was monitored on a CIWA 
scale and treated with MVI, thiamine, and folate.  She was seen 
by social work and given the contact information for rehab 
facilities.  Although patient was encouraged to enter ___ 
rehab, she refused.  She will seek outpatient treatment for her 
addiction.  Ms. ___ was warned on multiple occasions that 
if she continues to drink she will irreperably destroy her liver 
and could even die.

#  BACK PAIN:  Patient was started on a lidocaine patch and 
given oxycodone for breakthrough pain while in the hospital.
  
#  LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Likely a combination of alcoholic hepatitis 
and UTI; patient was started on ciprofloxacin.  Other infectious 
work-up was unrevealing.  On day prior to discharge, patient 
spiked a fever to 101 and was pan cultured.  CXR was unrevealing 
and urine was negative for infection after the Cipro.  Ms. 
___ was discharged on levofloxacin for a 5 day course.
  
#  MACROCYTIC ANEMIA:  Likely from folate and nutritional 
deficiency in setting of alcoholism.  Patient was started on MV, 
thiamine, and folate supplementation.  HCT was monitored 
throughout admission.

#  ANXIETY:  Patient with marked anxiety.  She would likely 
benefit from outpatient therapy and/or SSRI treatment.

#  SINUS TACHYCARDIA:  Likely in context of decompensated liver 
disease.  ECHO was within normal limits.  Patient was monitred 
on telemetry throughout hospitalization.

#  CONSTIPATION:  Patient was maintained on senna and colace.
 
Medications on Admission:
None.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Abdominal distention/pain:
She was treated empirically due to concern for spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis with ceftriaxone 2g x 1.  A diagnostic 
paracentesis was performed in the ED.  Ascitic fluid analysis 
was performed.  Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was ruled out 
given that the fluid cell count showed only 52 WBC; antibiotics 
were discontinued in this setting.  Subsequently, a large volume 
paracentesis was performed on ___ with 4.5L of fluids 
removed. After the procedure, her abdomen was less distended and 
less painful.  Fluid analysis again did not reveal SBP.  
.
#Alcoholic hepatitis:
Patient's liver synthetic function was monitored while 
hospitalized. She was maintained on her home regimen of 
lactulose. She also had 24-hr urine collection for copper to 
evaluate for ___ disease. 
.
#Leukocytosis and mild fever:
She had a temparature of 101 upon presentation in the ED.  She 
had no signs or symptoms of any infection.  Urine culture showed 
only GU flora, consistent with contamination. After arrival to 
the floor her temperature was stable, ranging from 99 to 101.  
Her WBC trended down throughout the hospitalization and was 11 
at the time of discharge.    
.
#Tachycardia:
Her heart rate was elevated in the 100-120s throughout the 
hospitalization. She had good oxygenation and had no complaints 
of SOB, dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations. The most likely 
etiology of this is pain, anxiety, and her low intravascular 
volume.  She was tachycardic in the 100s upon discharge.  
.
#Back pain:
Lumbosacral spine film revealed no skeletal abnormalities 
(vertebral compression fracture and osteomyelitis).  Her pain 
was present but well-controlled throughout the hospitalization 
with oxycodone ___ Q6H PRN pain.  Recommended follow up with 
her primary care provider to address management of her chronic 
pain.

hyperlipidemia, Hysterectomy, B12 deficiency, OA, carcinoid, 
cervical DJD, depression, SBO who presented with nausea, 
vomiting, weakness x 2 weeks and was found to have multiple 
liver and lung masses per CT consistent with metastatic cancer 
of unknown primary. 

Patient was treated with IV fluids overnight for dehydration. 
She refused to stay in the hospital for any further work-up or 
treatment and stated she would rather go home to to think and 
see to her affairs over the weekend and consider pursuing

physician. Patient was dischaerged home at her request. Home 
medications were continued to which we added some symptomatic 
treatment for her cough with benzonatate and Guaifenesin. We 
held off on anti-emetics for now as she did not want to stay 
inhouse to make sure these would be well tolerated (would need 
to monitor for drug interactions given multiple QTc prolonging 
and serotonergic medications on her home meds).  She was 
instructed to maintain good hydration and try a soft diet at 
home if she can not tolerate regular diet. The patient met with 
SW who provided her with resources for community councelling. 
Outpatient appointments with oncology, GI and her PCP were set 
up and her PCP and mental health provider were updated. Her PCP

IMAGING: ___
Final Report 
HISTORY:  New diagnosis of metastatic cancer with unknown 
primary.  Assess for extent of lesions.   
COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis dated ___.  
TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT of the torso was performed with 
intravenous and oral contrast.  Coronal and sagittal 
reformations were provided.  Images are substantially degraded 
due to the patient's body habitus.   
FINDINGS: 
CHEST:  
There are innumerable pulmonary nodules, which have an upper 
lobe 
predilection, particularly in the left upper lobe.  The largest 
nodule 
measures 6 mm in diameter (sequence 3 image 8).  Calcification 
is noted within  the right pleural cavity (sequence 3 image 24), 
which is likely related to the patient's history of previous 
right lung surgery.  No pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  
No significant mediastinal, axillary or hilar adenopathy.  
Cardiac size is 
normal.  No pericardial effusion.  
ABDOMEN:  
The liver is enlarged and there are innumerable ___ density 
lesions throughout both lobes of the liver which are replacing 
the vast majority of the hepatic parenchyma.  The portal vein is 
patent.  No intra or extrahepatic duct dilatation.  The 
gallbladder is unremarkable.  There is a small amount of ascites 
adjacent to the right lobe of the liver.   
  
The right kidney is mildly compressed anteriorly due to the 
enlarged liver. There is a subcentimeter ___ density lesion in 
the upper pole of the right kidney, likely representing a 
subcentimeter cyst (sequence 5 image 31).  The right kidney is 
otherwise unremarkable.  The left kidney is within normal 
limits.  The adrenals and spleen are unremarkable.  The pancreas 
is within normal limits.  The small and large bowel are 
unremarkable.  No retroperitoneal or mesenteric adenopathy.  
  
PELVIS:  
The images of the pelvis are substantially degraded secondary to 
the patient's body habitus.  No pelvic masses are identified.  
The bladder is unremarkable.  The patient is status post 
supracervical hysterectomy.  No pelvic adenopathy. No free fluid 
within the pelvis.  
  
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  
Bilateral symmetrical sclerosis is identified on the iliac side 
of the 
sacroiliac joints, consistent with osteitis condensans ilii.  
There is severe degenerative change within the right hip joint 
with joint space loss and osteophyte formation.  No destructive 
osseous lesions.   
  
IMPRESSION: 
Multiple pulmonary and hepatic metastases.  No separate primary 
lesion 
identified.   

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo f with h/o recently diagnosed metastatic cancer of unknown 
primary presenting with nausea, vomiting, and fever to 101 on 
day of admission.  
.
# Fever/leukocytosis: Patient presented with fever and 
leukocytosis, which was initially concerning for post 
obstructive PNA. Patient was treated with vanc-cefepime-azithro 
for a day and a half, however CT torso was concerning for 
ongoing malignancy without evidence of primary tumor. There was 
no concern for a pneumonia. Consequently, abx were stopped on 
___. Patient felt weak and unable to go home, as she lives 
alone and so was screened by physical therapy and discharged to 
rehab facility. 
.
# Failure to thrive: Patient presents with 6 weeks of nausea, 
vomiting and poor PO intake likely from her enlarged liver. She 
continues to have bowel movements and pass gas. Patient now with 
albumin of 2.8, ketones in her urine, weight loss and new 
peripheral edema, concerning for poor nutrition/starvation 
ketosis. Nutrition consult followed the patient throughout her 
hospital stay and recommended ___ fat Carnation Instant 
Breakfast with Beneprotein.
.
# Chronic back pain:  Patient was continued on her home 
gabapentin. 
.
# Depression:  Patient was continued on home bupropion, 
sertraline  
.
# HCTZ: Patient's hctz was discontinued during her 
hospitalization due to poor PO intake and concern for 
dehydration. Blood pressures were well-controlled such that HCTZ 
was not deemed necessary. This issue should be readdressed by 
PCP.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Given patient's metastatic process, statin was 
discontinued during hospitalization to simplify her medical 
regimen.  
.
# Insomnia: Continued home trazodone  
.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for evaluation of several weeks of 
weakness and nausea. You had some markers of infection, so you 
were initially given antibiotics. However, a scan of your torso 
showed metastatic disease from a cancer of unknown origin in 
your liver and lungs. Your weakness and nausea are most likely 
due to your enlarged liver. 

You are scheduled to see your oncologist this week, so please 
follow-up with them so that they may proceed with the further 
diagnosis and treatment of your malignancy.

You are being discharged to a rehabilitation facility to help 
you regain some strength before going home. Your anticipated 
length of stay is LESS THAN 30 DAYS. 

Please see the attached sheet for your updated medication list. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital. We wish

Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous liver biopsy
 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with metastatic cancer of unknown primary 
(known lesions in lungs and liver) presenting with shortness of 
breath. She initially presented to ___ in ___ with abdominal 
pain and failure to thrive. Evaluation at that time included an 
abdominal CT scan that showed multiple lung and liver 
metastases. She has yet to undergo definite diagnosis with 
biopsy, and per recent oncology documentation seems disengaged 
with care.  
She was reportedly in her usual state of health until the 
evening prior to admission, when she developed acute on chronic 
shortness of breath while at rest. She reported midsternal chest 
ache associated with this shortness of breath. Pain is 
exacerbated by direct pressure; nothing seems to alleviate pain. 
She denied any pleuritic or exertional component to the chest 
pain or shortness of breath. She feels that symptoms are 
secondary to her ""cancer"" and ""feels as if the cancer has 
spread"". She reports stable, chronic nonproductive cough, which 
has been present over the preceding months.  
She was seen recently in the ED for evaluation of left greater 
than right lower extremity edema with lower extremity venous 
ultrasounds negative, without change in edema since since that 
visit. She denies associated fever, chills, sweats, PND, 
orthopnea, or positional component to pain. 
In the ED, initial vital signs were: 98.0 116 100/49 24 99% RA. 
Labs notable for leukocytosis to 17.9, hematocrit of 32, and 
lactate of 2.8. Urinalysis was positive, but with 19 epithelial 
cells. CTA was negative for central pulmonary embolus, focal 
consolidation, or pleural effusion, though did reveal 
innumerable pulmonary nodules, as well as enlarged liver with 
stable metastases. EKG was interpreted as sinus tachycardia and 
was overall consistent with prior. Ceftriaxone/azithromycin were 
initiated for possible pneumonia. Vital signs on  transfer were 
as follows: 97.9 107 100/60 22 100% RA. On arrival to the floor, 
she reports that shortness of breath has improved and that she 
is chest pain free.

Microbiology:
Blood x2 (___): No growth
Urine (___): No growth
Blood x2 (___): No growth

Pathology:
Liver biopsy (___):
Liver, core needle biopsy (A):
Adenocarcinoma, involving the liver (see note).
Note: Immunohistochemical stains are performed.  The tumor cells 
are positive for CK20 and CDX-2, and negative for CK7 and TTF-1. 
 These results are consistent with metastasis from a colorectal 
primary.

Imaging:
EKG (___):
Sinus tachycardia. Low voltage. Diffuse non-specific 
repolarization
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ 
repolarization
abnormalities are slightly more prominent.
___
___

Portable CXR (___):
Innumerable pulmonary metastases.  Possible mild pulmonary 
vascular
congestion.  Low lung volumes.

CTA (___):
1.  No central or segmental filling defect in the pulmonary 
arteries.
Evaluation is slightly limited due to suboptimal IV bolus. 
2.  Innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules, simas seen on the 
prior CT study on ___, slightly increased.  No focal 
consolidation or pleural effusion.  
3.  Enlarged liver with multiple hypodense lesions, with 
suggestion of
increased burden of disease.

Right upper quadrant ultrasound (___):
Extensive diffuse hepatic metastatic disease.  No evidence of 
biliary duct
obstruction.

Portable CXR (___):
1. Low lung volumes and mild pulmonary vascular congestion is 
unchanged. 
2. New small right fissural pleural effusion.
3. No new focal opacities to suggest pneumonia.  

Noncontrast head CT (___):
No acute intracranial process.  No mass is identified.  MRI is 
more sensitive for evaluation of metastases.

Left hip XR (___):
No definite lytic lesion; however, an MRI can be performed to 
evaluate for an osseous lesion if indicated.

Portable abdomen (___):
Radiographs of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrate a 
nonobstructed
bowel gas pattern.  A relative paucity of bowel gas is present 
in the upper and mid abdomen, likely due to marked enlargement 
of the liver, displacing bowel loops.  Note that the upright 
view is technically suboptimal, and limits evaluation for free 
intraperitoneal air.  If free intraperitoneal air is suspected 
clinically, a left lateral decubitus view of the abdomen would 
be recommended.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with metastatic cancer of unknown primary, 
including lesions in the liver and lungs, who initially 
presented with shortness of breath, likely due to worsening 
intrapulmonary tumor burden, and later underwent percutaneous 
liver biopsy with pathology consistent with metastatic colon 
cancer, prompting transfer to the oncology service and 
eventually discharged home with hospice.

Active Issues:
(1) Metastatic colon adenocarcinoma: CTA to exclude pulmonary 
embolus and right upper quadrant ultrasound on admission 
demonstrated progression of previously recognized metastatic 
cancer of unknown primary involving the liver and lungs, which 
had evaded diagnosis in the outpatient setting due to patient 
reluctance to engage with care. Percutaneous liver biopsy 
ultimately revealed primary colonic adenocarcinoma. Following 
discussion with her outpatient oncology providers, she was 
transferred to the inpatient oncology service for potential 
trial of FLOX. However, given the patient's very poor functional 
and nutritional status a goals of care discussion was held with 
the patient's HCP, ___ and it was decided to focus 
goals of care of comfort and symptom management and the patient 
was discharged home with home hospice. 

(2) Left thigh weakness/spinous tenderness: She was found to 
have focal left thigh weakness in association with diffuse 
spinous tenderness of unclear chronicity in the setting of 
preserved rectal tone without saddle anesthesia. She was noted 
to be incontinent of urine, but not feces. Given underlying 
malignancy, there was concern for bony metastases or cord 
involvement, with alternative consideration given to epidural 
abscess, prompting transient initiation of empiric antibiotic 
coverage with vancomycin/cefepim ___ to ___. Despite 
frequent persuasive efforts, she declined multiple attempts at 
lumbosacral MRI, including with lorazepam premedication, citing 
claustrophobia. Neuro exam was monitored and remained stable.

(3) Abdominal pain: She experienced intermittent abdominal pain 
and tenderness without peritoneal signs, concerning for 
obstruction in the setting of intraabdominal malignancy, 
particularly given episodes of emesis/hematemesis as below. 
While multiple KUBs were negative for obstruction, CT abdomen 
was planned to evaluate for alternative sources of 
intraabdominal pathology, but she declined on multiple 
occasions. Pain was controlled with acetaminophen and tramadol 
as needed.

(4) ? Hematemesis: She experienced a single episode of small 
volume emesis, reportedly approximately 100cc, streaked with 
blood and found to be guiac positive. Vital signs and hematocrit 
remained stable. IV pantoprazole was initiated for 
gastrointestinal prophylaxis, with subsequent discontinuation of 
PPI given no recurrence and questionable if first episode was 
true blood vs. red popsicle was eating at time. 
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was deferred in the absence of 
recurrent hematemesis; no prior EGDs were available in OMR. 

(5) Altered mental status: She was intermittently altered 
throughout admission, never oriented to more than person and 
place, with occasional difficulty following simple commands as 
compared to an uncertain baseline. Infectious work up, including 
blood and urine cultures and CTA on admission with subsequent 
CXRs, was unrevealing. Noncontrast head CT was negative for 
acute intracranial process. Brain MRI for definitive exclusion 
of metastases could not be obtained due to claustrophobia/MRI 
aversion as above.  ABG on ___ without signs of CO2 retention. 
History of opiates making patient sleepy per HCP as possible 
contributing factor and therefore these were discontinued. 
Hepatic encephalopathy also on differential given metastatic 
lesions to liver and asterixis on exam.  AMS could also be ___ 
to severe depression. Mental status monitored and remained 
stable and patient at baseline per HCP on discharge.

(6) Shortness of breath: She presented with acute onset 
shortness of breath without frank hypoxia. CTA on admission was 
negative for pulmonary embolus, though (subsegmental clot could 
not be excluded definitively), pleural effusion, or focal 
infiltrate. EKG and cardiac enzymes were reassuring against 
acute coronary syndrome.  Low voltages on EKG were consistent 
with prior, hence limited suspicion for pericardial effusion. 
Shortness of breath resolved over the course of admission 
without dedicated treatment, with the exception of nebulizers 
and expectorants as needed.

(7) Leukocytosis: White blood cell count was elevated and peaked 
at 20.6, consistent with recent baseline, likely reflecting 
underlying malignancy. As noted above, infectious work up 
including CTA, urine and blood cultures, and CXRs, was 
unrevealing. She remained afebrile, with the exception of 
isolated transient fever to 100, with stable vital signs. 

(8 )Liver function test abnormalities: AST remained elevated ___ 
to ___, alkaline phosphatase 260s to 380s, and total bilirubin 
2.1 to 2.6, likely due to hepatic infiltration of malignancy. 
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for cholecystitis 
or obstructive process. The possibility of superimposed 
intraabdominal process, such as infection, could not be excluded 
in the setting of abdominal pain with emesis as above, but she 
declined CT for further evaluation.

(9) Elevated lactate: Lactate was found to be 2.7-3.8 throughout 
admission despite copious IV fluids, likely reflecting 
compromised hepatic clearance in the setting of malignant 
infiltration. 

(10) Sinus tachycardia: She remained persistently tachycardic 
100s to 115s throughout admission in the setting of poor PO 
intake, but incompletely responsive to copious IV fluids. 
Tachycardia has been present since at least ___. Despite 
concurrent leukocytosis and elevated lactate, there was no clear 
infectious source, hence low suspicion for sepsis. Subsegmental 
pulmonary embolus could not be excluded on the basis of 
admission CTA, but shortness of breath was short lived, and she 
was never hypoxic. Hematocrit remained stable without signs of 
active bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as 
above.

(11) Depression: She appeared depressed with flat affect and 
seeming anhedonia throughout admission, with underlying 
depression likely affecting motivation to seek diagnosis and 
treatment of known malignancy. She denied active suicidal 
ideation and frequently declined home sertraline, particularly 
prior to liver biopsy, believing that it was supposed to be held 
preprocedurally despite explanation to the contrary. She was 
seen by social work throughout admission.

(12) Normocytic anemia: Hematocrit remained stable and 
consistent with recent baseline at 27 to 33 throughout 
admission, seemingly due to anemia of chronic disease on the 
basis of preadmission labs. Vital signs remained stable, with 
the exception of persistent tachycardia, without signs of active 
bleeding apart from isolated blood streaked emesis as above.

(13) Coagulopathy: INR of 1.2 to 1.8 was felt to reflect 
synthetic dysfunction in the setting of hepatic infiltration of 
malignancy, as well as poor oral intake. There were no signs of 
active bleeding, with the exception of transient hematemesis as 
above.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking part in your care during your admission 
to ___. As you know, you were 
admitted for shortness of breath, likely due to your underlying 
cancer, and there was no evidence of pneumonia or blood clot in 
the blood vessels of your lungs. Your shortness of breath 
resolved, but you were found to have weakness in your left thigh 
and abdominal pain. You declined imaging studies for further 
investigation of these findings. You underwent biopsy of your 
liver that revealed that the cancer known to affect your liver 
and lungs originated in your colon (large bowel). You were 
transferred to the oncology service, but unfortunately 
chemotherapy would do more harm for you than good.  After a long 
discussion with you and your health care proxy, it was decided 
that you will go home to be with your family and loved ones.  We 
will also set up hospice services for you so that they can help 
with any issues that arise while you are at home.

ECG ___  7:56:06 ___  
Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. The Q-T interval is 400 
milliseconds. Q waves in leads V1-V2 with ST-T wave 
abnormalities extending to lead V6. Consider prior anterior 
myocardial infarction. Since the previous tracing of ___ 
atrial premature beats are not seen. The Q-T interval is 
shorter. ST-T wave abnormalities are less prominent.  
 
CXR ___:
PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes. 
Tiny bilateral pleural effusions are new since ___. No 
signs of pneumonia or pulmonary vascular congestion. Heart is 
top normal in size though this is stable. Aorta is markedly 
tortuous, unchanged. Aortic arch calcifications are seen. There 
is no pneumothorax. No focal consolidation. Partially imaged 
upper abdomen is unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Tiny pleural effusions, new. Otherwise unremarkable.

ECHO ___:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 
>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch 
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully 
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of 
mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate 
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic 
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting 
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is an anterior 
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular 
cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular 
systolic function. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Mild-moderate 
mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the 
severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are increased and 
moderate PA hypertension is now identified.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman with h/o hypertension, hypelipidemia, diabetes 
mellitus on insulin, cerebellar-medullary stroke in ___, 
stage ___ CKD followed by Dr ___ presenting with fatigue and 
DOE for a few weeks, markedly worse the morning of admission. 
The patient has known diastolic dysfunction. Of note, she has 
been noncompliant with her medications at home. On arrival to 
the floor, she required hydralazine 20 mg to bring down her BP. 
She has likely had elevated BPs at home for a while, which is 
contributing to her SOB, CHF exacerbation, and secondary demand 
myonecrosis (hypertensive urgency) with mildly elevated 
troponin.

# CAD: Although she did not have a classic anginal presentation, 
patient has several risk factors for acute coronary syndrome. 
Her only symptom was SOB in the setting of elevated BPs 
attributed to medication noncompliance at home. Her troponin 
fell from 0.05 at admission to 0.01 at discharge in the setting 
of renal dysfunction, but there was not a clear rise and fall to 
suggest an acute infarction from plaque rupture and thrombosis. 
She was scheduled for an outpatient stress test to evaluate for 
evidence of ischemia from flow-limiting CAD. We decreased ASA to 
81 mg from 325 mg daily to decrease the risk of bleeding. Her 
LDL was found to be 146. We wanted to change her from 
simvastatin to the more potent atorvastatin (and avoid issues 
with drug-drug interactions), but her insurance would not cover 
atorvastatin. She was therefore switched to pravastatin 80 mg at 
discharge. From a cardiac standpoint, we did not feel that 
Plavix was necessary for CAD, but her neurologist was contacted 
and wanted Plavix continued. We had to stop metoprolol due to HR 
in the ___ during admission even off metoprolol.
  
# Pump: Last echo in ___ showed low normal LVEF. Her current 
presentation was consistent with CHF exacerbation with bilateral 
pleural effusions, dyspnea, and elevated NT-Pro-BNP. Her TTE 
showed mild-moderate mitral and moderate tricuspid 
regurgitation, LVEF 50-55%, and pulmonary hypertension. We 
changed her HCTZ to Lasix 40 mg PO at discharge. This medication 
can be uptitrated as needed.

# Hypertension: The patient's nephrologist, Dr. ___, agreed 
with our proposed medication adjustments, but recommended 
staying away from clonidine. There has been a H/O medication 
non-adherence. Social work was involved in discharge planning, 
and ___ will be assisting the patient at home. We added 
lisinopril 20 mg daily, Lasix 40 mg daily and continued 
nifedipine 120 mg daily. Her atenolol was stopped due to her 
renal dysfunction, but her metoprolol had to be stopped due to 
bradycardia. She should continue on once a day medication dosing 
to help with compliance.

# ? COPD: The patient may have a component of COPD as she was 
wheezing on admission and responded to albuterol. She was given 
a prescription for albuterol prn.

Transitional Issues:
- She will be scheduled for outpt stress stress test
- She has follow-up appointments with Dr. ___ and Dr. 
___ and both can work on uptitrating her BP 
meds as needed.
- ___ will need to work with patient on medication compliance.

CXR: ___
Right upper lobe pneumonia or mass.  However, given right hilar 
fullness, a mass resulting in post-obstructive pneumonia is 
within the 
differential.  Recommend chest CT with intravenous contrast for 
further 
assessment. 

TTE: ___
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild 
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
near-akinesis of the inferior, inferolateral and basal lateral 
segments. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 
35-40%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric jet 
of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There 
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. 
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
regional LV wall motion abnormalities are new. Severity of 
mitral regurgitation has increased.

CARDIAC CATH: ___
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no 
obstructive disease.  The LAD had a moderate disease in the mid 
artery and a diagonal branch had an 80% proximal lesion.  The 
Lcx had a 70% proximal lesion.  The RCA was totally occluded 
mid-vessel. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Recommend CABG evaluation

CT CHEST: ___
1.  Diffuse confluent ground-glass opacities predominantly in 
the right upper lobe and right lower lobe most likely represent 
residual pulmonary edema, localized to the right lung because of 
direction of jet in mitral 
regurgitation.  
2.  Possible pulmonary hypertension. 
3.  Moderate coronary artery disease. 

CAROTID US: ___
No evidence of hemodynamically significant internal carotid 
stenosis on either side. 

ECHO ___- PCI)
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis. No 
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. An eccentric jet of mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the LVEF has increased. The degree of MR seen has decreased. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with ___, HTN, diabetes, CKD presented with 
increased dyspnea and non-productive cough without fevers or 
elevated white count, initially admitted to ___ with concern 
for pneumonia. However, was found to have ST-changes, enzyme 
leak, new wall motion abnormality consistent with a recent 
cardiac event and had no evidence of pneumonia (no fevers, wbc, 
lactate, normal vitals, CXR with likely one sided pulmonary 
edema from mitral regurgitation). She was seen by cardiology who 
transferred the patient to cardiology floor.

# Acute systolic CHF exacerbation/mitral regurgitation: 
Likely secondary to ischemic valvular disease resulting in 
worsening mitral regurgitation. ECHO also with akinetic inferior 
wall segments, which also supports an ischemic event. Cardiac 
cath revealed 3 vessel disease. Patient was managed medically 
with lasix, lisinopril, and metoprolol. Cardiac surgery was 
consulted for possible CABG and mitral valve repair/replacement. 
However, given her multiple comorbidities, she is extremely high 
risk and surgery was deferred. Therefore, the decision was made 
to revascularize the patient with PCI to see if the patient 
would regain function of her mitral valve. Patient received a 
bare metal stent in the LCx and plain old balloon angioplasty in 
the diagonal artery. Repeat echo showed improvement of her 
mitral regurgitation. 

# NSTEMI/CAD:
As evidenced by EKG changes and troponin leak. Patient was 
briefly started on a heparin drip prior to her first cardiac 
catheterization. As above, cardiac catheterization revealed 
3-vessel disease. Patient was initially medically managed with 
aspirin, plavix, metoprolol, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. As 
the patient would be too high risk for CABG, patient returned to 
the cath lab and had a bare metal stent and POBA. She will 
require plavix for at least 1 month.

# Hypertension: Patient remained normotensive. Continued 
nifedipine at half of her home dose. Continued on lisinopril. 
She was also started on metoprolol as above for CHF.

# Diabetes: Continued home insulin regime. 
 
# CKD stage IV: Baseline Cr 2.5-2.8 per renal notes. Currently 
at baseline. 

# History of CVA: Continued home aspirin and clopidogrel. 

# GERD: Continued home ranitidine.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
* Will need follow up with a cardiologist. Patient will be 
scheduled to follow up with the first available CMED 
cardiologist. 
* Will need plavix for at least one month (day of bare metal 
stent placement = ___.
* Atorvastatin dose increased to 80mg (per pharmacy, her 
insurance will cover. Her co-pay will be $10/month).
* Consider titrating nifedipine dose back to 120mg if still 
hypertensive. 
* Please recheck Chem7 at next appointment to evaluate for ___ 
secondary to dye received during cardiac catheterization.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. As you recall, you were admitted for shortness 
of breath. This was because one of your heart valves was weak, 
which caused fluid to build up in your lungs. Your heart valve 
was weak because there was a blockage in one of your heart 
arteries. You underwent a procedure, called cardiac 
catheterization, which opened up the blocked arteries. Your 
valve and heart are pumping much more efficiently now. We are 
glad you are feeling better. Please weigh yourself every 
morning, and call your MD if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs 
over 24 hours.

Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea and chest tightness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ Pharmacologic nuclear stress test
 
History of Present Illness:
___ year old female with history of HTN, HLD, hx of CVA, CAD s/p 
BMS to circumflex and POBA (___), on Aspirin and Plavix, CHF 
(EF 45% in ___, diabetes, presenting with acute onset 
shortness of breath and substernal chest tightness since ___ 
evening. 

Patient notes that ___ evening had a large seafood dinner 
which is not usual for her, and then later around 10pm had acute 
onset of SOB feeling like she could not take deep breaths with 
chest tightness (patient notes this is her ""angina""). Denies 
pleuritic component to CP, described as central and across lower 
rib cage, persistent since onset, no radiation to the 
shoulders/jaw/back, no diaphoreses. Worsens with activity, 
improves somewhat with rest. Patient does not it feels like 
other episodes when she then required her stent placement. Took 
a SLNx1, which improved her symptoms though these persisted, but 
almost immediately led to abdominal discomfort with vomiting x1, 
nonbloody with dinner pieces. ___, 1 day prior to admission, 
decided to see if her pain improved on its own, then when it 
persisted on ___, husband arranged for UC appt at ___ 
___. At PCP, ___, SBP up to 200s, EKG with ST 
depressions in the precordial leads, specifically V3, V4 and V5, 
given full dose ASA and SLNx1, and sent to the ED given concern 
for ACS versus HTN emergency. 

Patient reporting baseline sleeps with 2 pillows, unchanged 
recently, no cough, PND, orthopnea with 2 pillows. Worsening DOE 
since onset of symptoms, now unable to complete a block where 
she used to be able to walk a few blocks at a time without 
stopping ___ SOB/CP. Denies new ___ edema (baseline says L leg > 
R).

Also had emesis last night x 1; no diaphoresis, no chest pain, 
no radiation of symptoms anywhere. No diarrhea or constipation, 
no dysuria, no focal weakness/numbness. On ROS, also with some L 
leg tingling intermittently, stable and chronic. Had diarrhea x1 
on ___ following ___ seafood dinner, normal BMs since 
then. 
 
In the ED initial vital signs; T 98 P 88 BP 190/120 R 18 O2 Sat 
98% 3L nasal cannula. Labs notable for Cr 2.1 (baseline 
2.1-2.7), BUN 29. wbc 4.3, H/H 8.6/26.0, Plt 147. Initial and 
rpt Tn <0.01. BNP 4279. CXR showed no pulmonary edema, pleural 
effusions, or consolidation, borderline cardiomegaly. The 
patient received carvedilol, nebulizers, and IV lasix. It is 
unclear how much UOP the patient has as it was not documented in 
the ED. 

The patient was seen by cardiology in the ED who felt that in 
the setting of systolic heart failure, her dyspnea was likely 
due to a CHF exacerbation in the setting of dietary 
indiscretion. Diuresis was recommended in addition to increasing 
carvedilol to 12.5mg BID, as well as a nuclear stress test this 
morning.

On the floor, the patient c/o of some improved dyspnea/chest 
tightness as well as wheezing (no COPD/asthma history, no 
significant smoking history), but otherwise has no acute 
complaints. Given her continued SOB and wheezing, she was 
written for nebulizers and steroids for reactive airway disease 
overnight.

==== IMAGING ====

___ CHEST (PA AND LAT):
The lungs are clear of consolidation, effusion, or edema. 
Cardiac silhouette is top normal. Descending thoracic aorta is 
tortuous with atherosclerotic calcification seen at the arch. No 
acute osseous abnormalities identified. 
IMPRESSION:  
No acute cardiopulmonary process.

___ P-MIBI:
Clinical Indication: SS CHEST TIGHTNESS ASSESS FOR EVIDENCE OF 
ISCHEMIA  
HISTORY: ___ yo woman with a history of CAD and CHF referred for 
evaluation of chest pain and dyspnea.

SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB: 
For pharmacologic coronary vasodilatation dipyridamole was 
infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142 
milligram/kilogram/min. She had no anginal symptoms or ischemic 
ECG changes.

TECHNIQUE: 
ISOTOPE DATA: (___) 11.0 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Rest; 
(___) 29.6 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress; DRUG DATA: (Non-NM 
admin) Dipyridamole;

IMAGING METHOD:
Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi. 
Tracer was injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining 
the resting images. 
Following resting images and following intravenous infusion, 
approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-99m sestamibi 
was administered intravenously. Stress images were obtained 
approximately 30 minutes following tracer injection. 
Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT. 
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial 
perfusion model. 

FINDINGS: 
The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and 
breast attenuation.
Left ventricular cavity size is increased.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the left ventricular myocardium. 
Gated images reveal normal wall motion. 
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 59% with an 
EDV of 117 ml.

IMPRESSION:
1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 
2. Increased left ventricular cavity size with normal systolic 
function.
Compared with prior study of ___, the cavity size is 
larger.
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with history of HTN, CVA, CAD (s/p BMS to 
circumflex in ___, CHF (EF 45% in ___ who presented 
with acute onset shortness of breath and substernal chest 
tightness.

# Shortness of breath:
Patient with acute onset SOB following seafood meal with 
associated chest tightness (see below). Patient with crackles 
and expiratory rhonchi on lung exam. CXR did not show 
significant pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, or consolidation 
although her BNP was elevated. Per pharmacy records, patient had 
not refilled lasix prescription since ___. Overall, 
presentation was most consistent with a mild CHF exacerbation. 
She received treatment with IV lasix and her shortness of breath 
subsequently improved quickly. She was able to be transitioned 
to a PO regimen of lasix 40mg qday on ___ (day of discharge). 
Dry weight on day of discharge was 75.9kg.

# Chest Tightness:
Patient reported chest tightness associated with her shortness 
of breath. Was given aspirin and SL nitroglycerin in her PCP's 
office prior to being directed to the ED. Troponin was negative 
x2. EKG without evidence of acute ischemia. Due to her 
significant CAD history, she underwent a P-MIBI on ___ which 
was unremarkable. Her chest tightness was thought to be of 
non-cardiac etiology.

# HTN:
Patient presented with SBP of 190-200. Cardiology was consulted 
and recommended increasing her carvedilol from 6.25mg BID to 
12.5mg BID. With this change, and continuation of her other home 
medications, her blood pressure decreased to systolics in range 
of 110-146 on day of discharge. It is unclear whether her very 
elevated BP on admission was occurring in the setting of 
medication non-compliance. Nifedipine was decreased from BID to 
daily given increased carvedilol and addition of Lasix (which 
patient was believed to have been non-compliant with prior to 
this admission).

==== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ====

found to have bilateral unprovoked DVT. She was treated with a 
heparin drip and had many bleeding events during her stay: she 
developed an upper GIB, had an EGD, and was followed by GI 
during her admission. The heparin drip was stopped and then 
re-started once her coffee-ground emesis resolved. Her stools 
were guiac positive, however no active blood was found on rectal 
exam. GI felt that colonoscopy could be deferred to out patient. 
Additionally she developed a left arm hematoma. The heparin drip 
was stopped and then re-started once her hematoma was felt to be 
stable. She had left radial as well as bilateral lower extremity 
___ dopplerable pulses throughout admission. Hematology was 
consulted after the patient developed a left arm hematoma and 
the drip was slowly uptitrated as per their recommendations. She 
was successfully bridged to coumadin with an INR on discharge of 
2.0. She was discharged to rehab as per ___ recs.

================================================================

___ y/o female with PMHx significant for CAD, HTN, HLD, T2DM, CKD 
stage IV, PVD (s/p in ___, left superficial femoral artery), 
presented with lower Left leg numbness and pain since yesterday 
evening, with ultrasound bilateral lower extremities showing 
bilateral posterior tibial veins DVT's.

# Unprovoked Bilateral DVTs: No clinical signs of PE on 
admission or during stay, positive bilateral DVTs on LENIs. Pain 
and swelling improved on anticoagulation. Patient was bridged 
with heparin drip to therapeutic warfarin with INR goal ___. Due 
to continually supratherapeutic PTT > 150 on heparin drip, 
hematology was consulted and no further workup was deemed 
necessary. Heparin drip was carefully uptitrated as needed. 
Clopidogrel was stopped per outpatient cardiologist. Patient 
will need age-appropriate cancer screening including colonoscopy 
and mammogram. Patient will follow-up in ___ clinic for 
anticoagulation management and should continue on warfarin for 
at least 3 months. 

# Upper GI bleed: Patient developed 1 episode large coffee 
ground emesis while on heparin drip with PTT > 150. Received 2U

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a past medical 
history of type-2 DM, hypertension, stage IV CKD, CAD s/p 
distant MI and bare metal stent, stroke, recent unprovoked DVTs 
on Coumadin, and recent upper GI bleed, who was sent to ___ by 
her physician for anemia. 

# Anemia: 
Patient presented with Hgb of 6.5, down from her recent baseline 
of ~7.5 since her ___ hospitalization. Upon presentation she 
had a new macrocytic anemia. Hemolysis labs were negative. She 
received two units of packed red cells with an appropriate rise 
in her Hgb to 9.0. Stool was guiac negative, with no reports of 
dark stool or blood in stool. Her hemoglobin remained stable at 
this level, there was no overt bleeding, and her stool was guiac 
negative. After transfusion the patient reported significant 
improvement in her shortness of breath and fatigue. Given her 
history of gastritis and diverticulosis, a GI bleed was believed 
responsible for her anemia. Patient should receive an 
EGD/colonoscopy as an outpatient. 

# Acute exacerbation of heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction: 
The patient was also found to be slightly volume overloaded, and 
was treated with 2x40mg IV Lasix, with good urine output and 
symptomatic improvement. Her pulmonary edema and peripheral 
edema resolved with diuresis.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Gastic ulceration: 
Continued on home pantoprazole BID

# Hypertension:
Continued on home nifedipine, carvadilol, lisinopril.

# Stage IV Chronic Kidney Disease: 
Creatinine remained at baseline (b/l Cr 2.1-2.6) during 
admission.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
======================
--Patient's Anemia is thought to be due to slow GI bleed given 
history of gastritis and diverticulosis. Please schedule 
EGD/colonoscopy within the next month
--Patient continued on Coumadin for bilateral DVTs; please 
continue to weigh the risks and benefits of anticoagulation 
given history of bleed.

IMAGING
=====
___ CXR
FINDINGS: 
There is mild pulmonary edema with superimposed region of more 
confluent consolidation in the left upper lung.  There are 
possible small bilateral pleural effusions.  Moderate 
cardiomegaly is again seen as well as tortuosity of the 
descending thoracic aorta.  No acute osseous abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION: 
Mild pulmonary edema with superimposed left upper lung 
consolidation, potentially more confluent edema versus 
superimposed infection.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year-old female with history of hypertension, CAD s/p DES 
with ischemic MR and systolic dysfunction, ___, hx of DVT, who 
admitted for CHF exacerbation.

# Acute on chronic decompensated heart failure: presented in the 
setting of high salt diet with dyspnea on exertion, decreased 
exercise tolerance, ___ edema, crackles on exam, elevated BNP to 
10K, 8lbs above dry weight and pulmonary congestion on CXR. 
Later discovered on pharmacy review that patient had not filled 
torsemide after last outpatient Cardiology appointment where she 
was instructed to start taking it. Troponins cycled and 
negative. On admission, she was placed on a salt and fluid 
restricted diet. She was diuresed with IV Lasix 80mg for 2 days 
and then transitioned to po torsemide 40mg with steady weight 
decline and net negative fluid balance of goal -___ and 
stable renal function. Electrolytes repleted for goal Mg>2 and 
K>4. She was continued on home carvedilol 12.5mg BID, 
atorvastatin 80mg daily and lisinopril 40mg daily for blood 
pressure control and increased home nifedipine CR from 30 to 
60mg BID to achieve goal SBP <140. Discharged with close PCP and 
___ to monitor weights and blood pressure 
control.

# Hypertension: She was continued on home carvedilol 12.5mg BID, 
atorvastatin 80mg daily and lisinopril 40mg daily for blood 
pressure control and increased home nifedipine CR from 30 to 
60mg BID to achieve goal SBP <140. 

# Positive U/A: patient asymptomatic but with 32WBCs, ___, 
+bacteria (although 3 epis). Asymptomatic with no 
fevers/dysuria/malaise. Urine culture negative.

# Left upper lung consolidation: infiltrate per Radiology read 
on admission CXR. No cough, fevers, leukocytosis. Rereviewed 
with on-call radiologist who favored pulmonary edema with no 
need for repeat imaging or PNA treatment unless clinically 
indicated. Monitored without any significant clinical findings.

# DVT: anticoagulated on Coumadin goal 2.0-3.0, no signs of 
thrombus on exam. Daily INR trended and continued on home 
Coumadin 5mg daily. 

# Anemia: no signs of external loss, specifically denying any 
melena. Chronically anemic with baseline ___, presented with Hgb 
8. Likely ___ renal disease and ACD however elevated MCV 
indicates possible reticulocytosis. Altogether low suspicion for 
GIB so Coumadin was continued. Reticulocytes 2.4 which is 
inappropriate arguing against acute loss. Trended daily CBC with 
noted uprising by discharge.

# Chronic kidney disease, stage IV- baseline ___, likely ___ 
HTN and DM. Renally dosed medications and trended Cr with no 
significant change. 
# HLD: continued home atorvastatin
# DM: held home 25U 70/30.  Patient maintained on aspart ISS and 
glargine qHS with good glycemic control.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and 
weight gain.  This was likely caused by an exacerbation of your 
heart failure possibly from salty foods over the holiday. 

While you were in the hospital:
- we gave you IV diuretics to help remove extra fluid
- we checked for pneumonia with a chest x-ray, there was no sign 
of a pneumonia
- we checked for signs on new clots in your legs, there was no 
new clot

Now that you are going home:
- continue to take all of your medications as prescribed
- monitor your salt intake, this should be no more than 2 grams 
every day, ask your doctors for help with this if you do not 
know how to keep track of your salt
- continue to weigh yourself every morning, call your doctor if 
weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
- follow-up with your primary care doctor regarding your blood 
pressure and blood sugar control

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

Imaging:

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:  Mild perihilar prominence, suspected to represent 
mildly prominent pulmonary vessels without definite pneumonia.  
Streaky left basilar opacification seen only on the frontal view 
is probably due to minor atelectasis or scarring. 
.  
CT A/P ___: 
1.  No acute intra-abdominal pathology. There is diverticulosis 
and sequelae of prior inflammation, but no active 
diverticulitis. 
2.  3-mm nodule seen along the right major fissure and right 
lower lobe.  According to ___ guidelines, in the absence 
of risk factors, no further followup is needed.  If patient has 
risk factors such as smoking, followup chest CT at 12 months is 
recommended to document stability. 

CXR ___:
There are low lung volumes with an appearance of bronchovascular 
crowding.  Despite this, there is likely mild vascular 
congestion and edema.  No focal consolidation is seen with 
linear bibasilar atelectasis.  The heart is top normal in size 
with aortic totuosity.

# Fevers: Likely secondary to pneumonia, but possibly a viral 
illness. Most likely not bacterial process but no leukocytosis, 
just PMN predominance. Urine legionella neg. CXR underwhelming 
for pnuemonia but given poor PO intake and overall constellation 
of symptoms without other localizing source and neg CT, so 
patient was treated presumptively for CAP.  O2 sats stable on 
room air during the day, but at night de-satted.  On exam, lungs 
with improved wheezing since yesterday. With ambulation, O2 87, 
on ___, repeat cxr with pulm edema likely due to IV fluid bolus 
day prior. She was given lasix 40mg POx1.  On day of d/c, sats 
mid ___ on RA, down to 88% with prolonged ambulation.  Pt not 
subjectively SOB, likely this is baseline given pt's habitus.  
Treated with albuterol nebs and Levofloxacin 750mg PO daily.  On 
d/c, will complete 5 day course of levofloxacin.  
.  
# Hypotnatremia: Na 134 on am of discharge, improved from lowest 
of 129 .  Based on urine lytes/osm and serum osm, most likely 
SIADH secondary to pulmonary process.
.
# Diabetes: Stable.  Continued home Lantus 100U qhs and ISS.  
Held metformin in house.  Was on diabetic diet.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital for a pneumonia.  You were 
started on antibiotics which you will need to continue for one 
more day (as listed below).  You were also a little bit 
dehydrated when you came in, so you received some IV fluids to 
help hydrate you. 

You sodium levels in your blood were a bit low.  This was most 
likely due to the infection in your lungs.  As we treated your 
pneumonia, your sodium levels improved.

The following changes were made to your medications: 
- Please START levofloxacin 750mg daily for 1 more day

If you begin to feel more short of breath or more sick, please 
don't hesitate to call your primary care physician.

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old woman with h/o divertic s/p colectomy here with 
elevated WBC and nausea 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o abscess-NO IV contrast, PO only 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: RF

INDICATION: ___ woman with elevated white blood cell 
count and nausea, history of recent colectomy for recurrent 
diverticulitis.

COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis of ___.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images were obtained through the 
abdomen and pelvis after the administration of oral contrast. No 
intravenous contrast was administered. Multiplanar reformatted 
images were also obtained.

FINDINGS: 

The lung bases are clear. A 4-mm calcified granuloma in the 
right lung base is unchanged. Limited images of the heart are 
unremarkable. There is no pericardial effusion.

In the abdomen, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, adrenal 
glands, pancreas, stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of small 
and large bowel are unremarkable. There is no mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy. There is no free fluid or free air in the 
abdomen. Immediately adjacent to the left common iliac artery, 
is a linear focus of hyper-attenuating material, with the 
appearance of suture material, largely unchanged from the prior 
examination.

In the pelvis, suture material is seen in the distal sigmoid 
colon, unchanged in appearance from prior examination and 
consistent with colonic anastomosis. There is no evidence of 
stricture or obstruction at this site. There is no local fluid 
collection to indicate abscess. There are no signs of 
inflammation. The intrapelvic loops of small and large bowel are 
unremarkable, containing air and stool in a normal pattern 
without bowel dilatation. The appendix is visualized and is 
normal. The urinary bladder, uterus, and adnexa are 
unremarkable. There are no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes in 
the pelvis. A fat-containing left inguinal hernia is unchanged.

Examination of soft tissues reveals stranding and subcutaneous 
air of the soft tissues along the midline lower anterior 
abdominal wall, slightly larger in size than on the prior 
examination of approximately 2 weeks ago. Additionally, a small 
focus of fluid attenuating material now extends from the 
abdominal wall musculature through the subcutaneous tissues, and 
appears to drain into an external collecting device. No discrete 
fluid collection is identified to indicate abscess formation, or 
that would be amenable to drainage. However, this appearance 
suggests continued cellulitis.

Examination of osseous structures reveals mild degenerative 
disease at L5-S1 and are otherwise unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of sigmoid colon anastomosis without 
obstruction or abscess formation.
2. Stranding and subcutaneous air along the lower abdominal wall 
in the midline, indicating cellulitis, but without discrete or 
drainable fluid collection

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
GI: Admitted in early morning on ___ the pt was made NPO with 
IVF resuscitation.  A abdominal/pelvic CT was done and 
demonstrated a stable sigmoid anastomosis without any fluid 
collections or free air.  Over the first night her urine output 
increased and a foley was not placed.  Due to her constant loose 
stools, toxin screens of C.diff were sent and returned negative. 
 By HD2, the nausea persisted an a GI consult was obtained.  The 
GI service believed the nausea to be related to baseline reflux 
exacerbated by her postop course, including a wound infection.  
Per their recommendations, she was started on an antacid and 
upon discharge she will follow up with a gastroenterologist to 
determine her H.pylori status.   Prior to discharge, she was 
tolerating a low residue diet and able to hydrate herself.

small echogenic focus within the right ovary measuring 5 x 4 x 4 
mm, likely a small hemorrhagic cyst. Both ovaries demonstrate 
normal arterial and venous waveforms.   
IMPRESSION:  
1. No evidence of ovarian torsion.  
2. Small right ovarian hemorrhagic cyst. 
.
CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast ___:  Scattered calcified 
granulomas in 
the lung bases are stable. There is no new focal pulmonary 
nodule, 
consolidation, or effusion. The cardiac apex is within normal 
limits.  
Complete evaluation of the intra-abdominal viscera is limited by 
the 
non-contrast technique. However, the liver appears homogeneous 
without focal lesion. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal 
dilatation is identified.  The gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas 
appear within normal limits. The adrenal glands are symmetric 
without focal nodule. The kidneys appear homogeneous without 
focal lesion or hydronephrosis. The abdominal aorta is 
non-aneurysmal throughout its visualized course. The second and 
third portions of the duodenum are equivocally thickened which 
may be due to underdistension. No small bowel obstruction is 
identified. The appendix is well visualized and is normal in 
appearance. There is no free fluid or free air. 
  
CT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST ___: Initial images 
demonstrated a solid mass like abnormality in the cecal tip 
measuring approximately 3 cm (2:51).  As this was potentially 
concerning for a cecal mass, rescanning of a limited portion of 
pelvis was performed after passage of oral contrast, confirming 
the finding and demonstrating a 3 cm mass with thickening of the 
adjacent cecal wall (601:15). The adjacent appendix is normal 
and there is no pericecal inflammatory change.  
The remainder of the colon is normal without evidence of 
obstruction or 
inflammation. The surgical anastomosis within the lower midline 
pelvis 
appears unremarkable. There is no pelvic free fluid. The uterus 
and adnexa 
appear within normal limits. The bladder is markedly distended 
but is 
otherwise unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged pelvic or 
inguinal lymph nodes are identified. 
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No bone destructive lesion or acute fracture 
is 
identified.  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Findings consistent with a 3 cm cecal mass and thickening of 
the cecal tip concerning for neoplasm. Atypical infectious 
process causing this appearance is felt less likely due to lack 
of inflammatory stranding. Recommend colonoscopy for further 
evaluation.  
2. Normal appendix, no signs of inflammation. 
3. No small or large bowel obstruction. 
4. Equivocal thickening of duodenum likely related to 
underdistention.  

Colonoscopy ___:
Findings:  
 Lumen: Evidence of a previous end to end ___ 
anastomosis was seen at the sigmoid colon.  
 Protruding Lesions A ulcerated 3 cm mass of malignant 
appearance was found in the cecum. The scope traversed the 
lesion. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at 
the cecum.  
 Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula with small openings were 
seen in the descending colon.  
Impression: Mass in the cecum (biopsy)
Diverticulosis of the descending colon
Previous end to end ___ anastomosis of the sigmoid 
colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum 
.
PATHOLOGY:
DIAGNOSIS: 
""Cecal mass"", mucosal biopsies: 
Colonic mucosa with focal ischemic change and abundant 
associated ulceration, exudate, and granulation tissue 
formation; no carcinoma or dysplasia in these samples.  Five 
levels are examined.

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year-old female with history significant for 
diverticulitis s/p sigmoid resection in ___, who presented with 
abdominal pain and was found to have cecal mass.  
.  
# Abdominal pain: Was most likely related to hemorrhagic ovarian 
cyst.  Initially, patient had significant pain that was not 
relieved with dilaudid.  However, over the course of several 
days her pain resolved on its own and she no longer required any 
pain medications.  Bloodwork and imaging were not suggestive of 
any intra-abdominal infection.  The patient was advised to 
follow-up with her gynecologist regarding her ovarian cyst, and 
the need for continued therapy with low dose oral contraceptive. 
  
.  
# Cecal Mass: During the workup of this patient's abdominal 
pain, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 3 cm cecal mass 
concerning for malignancy.  During this hospitalization she 
underwent colonoscopy with biopsy of the mass.  She was 
instructed to follow-up with her outpatient gastroenterologist 
regarding the results of this biopsy in one week.  The biopsy 
was negative for malignancy.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a ___ year old woman s/p robotic radical cystectomy 
___ (with ileal conduit creation) with postop course 
complicated by bacteremia and abscess, LLE DVT (on prophylactic 
dosing lovenox) who presents with dyspnea on exertion for past 3 
days. 

Briefly, patient was initially admitted to the Urology service 
from ___ for robotic anterior exenteration with ileal 
conduit. She was discharged to rehab on prophylactic dosing 
lovenox for 1 month. She was then readmitted from ___ for 
ileus requiring NGT decompression, TPN. BCx grew Citrobacter, 
for which CTX was started. CT showed intra-abdominal, interloop, 
simple fluid collection and LLQ drain was placed by ___. Patient 
improved, passing BMs and tolerating PO, and was discharged on 
cipro/flagyl. She was also discharged on PO Bactrim for presumed 
UTI, though unclear if she actually took this. During this 
admission, she was noted to have new bilateral ___ edema. LENIs 
at the time showed aute deep vein thrombosis of the duplicated 
mid and distal left femoral veins. She was discharged on  
Enoxaparin Sodium 40 mg SC daily. She reports that her PCP 
started PO ___ 20mg daily and since then there has been 
improvement of the swelling. Per her report, a repeat ___ at 
the rehab facility (___) was negative for DVT.

Patient reports that she recovered well post-operatively and was 
doing well at her assisted living facility up until a week ago 
when she began experiencing dyspnea on exertion. She states that 
she typically is able to ambulate a block before stopping to 
catch her breath, however in the past week she has been unable 
to take more than a few steps. She states that it has become 
increasingly more difficult to ambulate from her bedroom to the 
bathroom. When visited by the NP her ambulatory saturation was 
noted to be in the ___ with associated tachycardia to 110, 
pallor and diaphoresis. She endorses associated leg swelling 
left worse than right, and she states that her thighs ""feel 
heavy"". She denies any associated chest pain, fever, chills, 
pain with deep inspiration, abdominal pain, rashes, dizziness, 
lightheadedness.

IMAGING
==========================
___ CXR
IMPRESSION: Hilar congestion without frank edema.  No convincing 
signs of pneumonia.

___ CTA chest showed:
1. Extensive pulmonary embolism with thrombus seen extending 
from the right main pulmonary artery into the segmental and 
subsegmental right upper, middle, and lower lobe pulmonary 
arteries. No right heart strain identified. 2. Additionally, 
there are smaller pulmonary emboli seen in the segmental and 
subsegmental branches of the left upper and lower lobes. 3. 
Several pulmonary nodules are noted, as noted previously, with 
the largest appearing spiculated and measuring up to 1 cm in the 
right middle lobe, suspicious for malignancy on the previous 
PET-CT. 4. Re- demonstration of 2 left breast nodules for which 
correlation with mammography and ultrasound is suggested.

___ ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval progression of deep vein thrombosis in the left 
lower extremity, with occlusive thrombus involving the entire 
femoral vein, previously only involving the mid and distal 
femoral vein.  There is additional nonocclusive thrombus in the 
deep femoral vein.  The left common femoral and popliteal veins 
are patent.
2. The bilateral calf veins were not visualized due to an 
overlying dressing. Otherwise no evidence of deep venous 
thrombosis in the right lower extremity.

___ TTE:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). 
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left 
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. 

___ CXR
IMPRESSION: 
Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___. 
Heart size top-normal.  Lungs grossly clear.  No pleural 
abnormality or evidence of central lymph node enlargement.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman s/p robotic radical cystectomy 
___omplicated by bacteremia and 
abscess, LLE DVT, currently on daily lovenox who presents with 
dyspnea on exertion and dyspnea on exertion and found to have 
large PE and progression of DVT.

# PE/DVT: Likely due to undertreatment of known LLE DVT with 
prophylactic dosing of lovenox. Given underdosing of lovenox, 
this was not thought to be treatment failure and IVC filter was 
deferred. She had no signs of right heart strain on imaging, 
EKG, exam. TTE showed no evidence of right heart strain. She was 
treated with a heparin gtt, then transitioned to treatment dose 
lovenox given malignancy associated thrombosis as noted in CLOT 
trial. She is quite symptomatic and requires oxygen 
supplementation, though improved during hospitalization. Please 
wean oxygen as tolerated.

# Pulmonary nodules: Known spiculated masses that were noted on 
CT in ___, concerning for primary lung malignancy vs mets. 
Current CT showed stable nodules still concerning for 
malignancy. She was evaluated by the thoracic team who 
recommended CT biopsy vs. surveillance. Given her current 
PE/DVT, the family and the patient decided for surveillance at 
this time. They will follow up with her primary care provider. 

# Enterococcal UTI
She was noted to have rising WBC in the setting of UCX from 
urostomy growing Enterococcus. Given her rising leukocytosis, we 
proceeded with treatment. She was started on IV Ampicillin and 
transitioned to macrobid, based on sensitivies. Leukocytosis 
improved on antibiotics. She should complete a 7 day course (day 
1: ___, day 7: ___. 

# Normocytic Anemia: No signs of bleeding, or hemolysis. Hb 
dropped to nadir of 7.3, stable at discharge at 7.5. Iron 
studies consistent with likely combination iron deficiency 
anemia and anemia of chronic disease with low iron but elevated 
ferritin and low TIBC. Would recommend checking again as 
outpatient and work-up as needed.

# ___ swelling: Likley multifactorial including venous 
insufficiency, as well as known LLE DVT. She responded quite 
well with compression stockings.

# Hx of bladder cancer: s/p ___ TURBT, high-grade TCC, T1 
(no muscle identified). Then in ___, pelvic MRI showed 
bladder mass invasion, perivesical soft tissue, anterior vaginal 
wall on right (C/W T4 lesion). In ___, underwent robotic 
TAH-BSO, lap radical cystectomy and anterior vaginectomy with 
pathology showing pT2b, node and margins negative. No plan for 
any further therapy at this time per Dr ___.

The patient is safe to discharge today, and >30min were spent on 
discharge day management services.

Transitional issues:
- She will need follow up chest CT for pulmonary nodules in 3 
months (___)
- To complete 7 day course for UTI with macrobid (day 7: ___
- Continue oxygen therapy and wean as tolerated to maintain O2 
sat > 92% 
- Please check CBC on ___ to ensure stability of h/h 
and demonstrate resolution of leukocytosis
- HCP: son, Dr. ___ ___

PERTINENT IMAGING:
==================
CT ABD&PEL W/ CONTRAST 
___
1. Interval decrease in size of the right hemipelvis fluid 
collection (7.0 x 6.5 x 11.3 cm, previously 10.0 x 12.7 x 14.8 
cm) with the anterior approach pigtail catheter unchanged in 
position.  The pigtail is again located partly within the 
collection and partly outside its wall. 
2. Interval increase in size of the left pelvic fluid 
collection, now 
measuring 14.7 x 16.2 x 23.3 cm (previously 13.6 x 13.9 x 23.0 
cm). Increased peripheral enhancement may suggest superimposed 
infection. 
3. No new fluid collection identified. 
  
CTA ABD & PELVIS
___
1. Decrease in size of right lower quadrant fluid collection 
that has 
percutaneous drain within it, with areas of high attenuation on 
noncontrast exam consistent with blood products, and associated 
hyperemia which is likely inflammatory, but without evidence of 
contrast extravasation. 
2. There is large stable fluid collection in the low left 
abdomen, pelvis with mild linear peripheral enhancement, 
infection cannot be excluded. 
3. There is severe left, and moderate to severe right 
hydroureteronephrosis, with delayed left nephrogram, stable from 
today.  Mass effect about anastomosis between distal ureters and 
neobladder has resolved all since ___, and while 
hydronephrosis may be from residual edema, if this does not 
resolve, alternative etiologies including stenosis, tumor 
infiltration should be excluded. 
4. Tiny hepatic lesion segment ___, attention to this area on 
subsequent 
followups recommended. 

CT INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURE
___ 
1.  Complete collapse the patient has recently drained left 
lower quadrant 
collection.  The catheter from this collection was removed. 
2.  Near complete collapse of the patient is originally drained 
collection in the mid pelvis, with pigtail catheter in place. 
3.  Left lower quadrant and deep pelvic collections as above.  
These findings were discussed with the team.  Given the 
patient's improving clinical status, the decision was made to 
pursue no further collection drainage at this time. 
4.  Severe bilateral hydronephrosis, as on prior examinations. 
RECOMMENDATION:  Given persistence of severe hydronephrosis, 
percutaneous 
nephrostomy tubes should be considered. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY:
==============
___ year old women with a history of bladder cancer s/p 
cystectomy, hysterectomy, and BSO now with ileal conduit, whose 
post operative course has been complicated by DVT/PE, ileus, and 
pelvic fluid collections w/ one LLQ drain presented with 
subjective fevers, lethargy, and bloody drain output. She was 
found to have worsening anemia and was given 2 units of pRBC 
with appropriate increase in hemoglobin noted. She was also 
found on CT imaging to have an interval increase in size of a 
left abdominal fluid collection. Decision was made to place a 
drain per ID. Fluid was sent and revealed: negative cultures, 
negative malignant cells, no evidence of lymphatic or urinary 
fluid. This new drain was subsequently removed per ___ as fluid 
collection was completely drained. The prior drain was still 
draining serosanguinous fluid and was kept in but repositioned. 
ID was consulted for the fevers, leukocytosis and fluid 
collections and was deemed to need antibiotics and tranisitioned 
from broad spectrum to IV ertapenem at discharge. Will require 
multiple follow ups and imaging as specified in the transitional 
issues. 
 
ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Pelvic fluid collections: patient arrived with one anterior 
drain putting out serosanguinous fluid. CT abdomen/pelvis 
revealed enlarging left fluid collection, and decision was made 
to place a drain per ___. The fluid was negative for malignant 
cells. The fluid had Cr 1 and triglycerides <9 suggesting that 
fluid collection is neither urine nor lymphatic fluid. Fluid 
culture was negative for bacteria. On interval imaging, the new 
enlarging fluid collection had completely collapsed and the 
drain was removed. As for the other fluid collection that 
already had a drain putting out serosanguinous fluid, it 
continued to drain serosanguinous fluid but at a lower rate than 
prior to admission. The drain was left in place as the fluid 
collection on imaging had not completely collapsed. BID - N 
cultures for the aforementioned fluid collection came back 
positive for MSSA but per ID, does not reflect rue 
intra-abdominal infection. Given that patient had a fever at OSH 
and a leukocytosis, she was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics 
with vanc, ceftaz and flagyl. This was tapered per ID team to IV 
zosyn. On discharge, ID recommended ertapenem for approximately 
4 weeks with final length of treatment to be determined by fluid 
collection changes on repeat imaging on outpatient basis. Mrs. 
___ remained afebrile, and leukocytosis resolved. 

#Pulmonary embolism: Likely developed in the setting of being 
diagnosed with a post-op DVT. She was placed on lovenox.  She 
was transitioned to heparin ggt as she needed ___ procedures and 
was transitioned back to lovenox but at a lower dose per weight 
dosing to 70mg q12H upon discharge. 

#Acute renal injury: SCr has been steadily rising from a 
baseline of around 0.04-0.06 in ___ to 1.1, likely 
___ obstructed uropathy ___ large pelbic fluid collections. ___ 
resolved over the course of her hospital stay with final Cr 0.8. 


#Hydronephrosis: bilateral and worsening on interval imaging 
from prior studies. Given patient's age, adequate urinary 
output, adequate creatinine clearance, and no significant 
electrolyte abnormalities, patient likely would not

vaginectomy in ___ c/b abdominal fluid requiring 
placement of drainage catheters, and recent hydronephrosis 
requiring placement of bilateral PCN tubes on ___, presenting 
from rehab with hematuria and weakness.

On arrival, pt had evidence of frank hematuria in her urostomy 
bag and PCN tubes. Her hemoglobin was initially 8.1, which 
subsequently dropped to 7.0 Her lovenox was held, and she was 
transfused with 1 U PRBC with an appropriate hemoglobin bump to 
8.2. Hematuria was likely caused by recent instrumentation in 
the setting of anticoagulation. Her hematuria improved, as did 
her dizziness/weakness. ___ was consulted and recommending 
capping her PCN tubes. After discussion with the patient's 
hematologist, it was decided to stop her lovenox treatment given 
that her DVT/PE were provoked in the setting of her recovery 
from surgery, and that she had received almost 6 months of 
treatment.

Secondary Issues:

# Asymptomatic bacteruria: Patient with asymptomatic bacteruria 
in setting of recent procedural manipulation. She was afebrile 
and without leukocytosis, so treatment with antibiotics was 
deferred.

Chief Complaint:
Facial weakness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
HPI: ___ RHF w/ hx GERD, mild depression, and prior migraines,
presents now with episode of facial numbness. She had been lying
on her left face, watching TV, and noticed when she got up that
her left face was numb as if she were injected with novacaine, 
in
a distribution that she traces along mid-V2 down to her jaw 
line.
She initially thought it was ___ the way she was lying, but
became concerned when it persisted. She endorsed a mild diffuse
dull HA that is not unusual for her. She states in some ways, it
felt as though a migraine were coming on, though the HA she had
was not typical of her past migraines. The numbness lasted 90
minutes, and has now resolved completely. There was no 
associated
weakness, no sensory changes outside of her face, no VC, 
vertigo,
or language impairment. She cannot recall something like this
happening before, and states that her day was otherwise routine.
On ROS, she notes that about 2 weeks ago she had diarrhea for 1
week which resolved spontaneously. She also endorses feeling
""achey"" 4 days ago, otherwise, her health has been normal.

1. No acute intracranial abnormality; specifically, there is no 
evidence of 
either acute or previous ischemic event. 
2. Normal cranial and cervical MRA, with no significant mural 
irregularity or 
flow-limiting stenosis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman with a hx of depression, GERD and 
migraines, presenting with an episode of facial numbness.

1. Facial numbness.  As this episode preceeded a headache, 
suspect likely due to a migraine equivalent, however episode 
could also be due to a TIA in the thalamus.  The patient had an 
MRI, which showed no signs of ischemia, and normal vasculature, 
making migraine equivalent a much more likely diagnosis.  
However, given the possibility of TIA, she has been started on a 
daily aspirin for future stroke prophylaxis.  Exam on discharge 
was notable for mild symmetric hyperreflexia in the lower 
extremities, but otherwise normal neurological exam, with no 
residual sensory deficits.
 
Medications on Admission:
NEXIUM 40 mg--1 capsule(s) by mouth once a day
PROZAC 20 mg--1 capsule(s) by mouth once a day

 
Discharge Medications:
1. Pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) Sig: One 
(1) Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) PO Q24H (every 24 hours).  
2. Fluoxetine 20 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO DAILY 
(Daily).  
3. Aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) Sig: One (1) 
Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) PO DAILY (Daily).  

 
Discharge Disposition:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Migraine 
 
Discharge Condition:
Mild symmetric hyperreflexia in the lower extremities, otherwise 
normal neurological exam.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for left sided facial numbness.  You had an 
MRI which showed no signs of ischemia.  It is suspected that 
this was related to migraine headaches, but we recommend that 
you start taking a full dose of aspirin.

If you notice new numbness, weakness, worsening headaches, or 
other new concerning symptoms, please return to the nearest ED 
for further evaluation.

Chief Complaint:
slurred speech
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
___ year old right-handed woman with hx of Atrial fibrillation on 
Eliquis (only once daily), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CHF
presents as transfer from OSH after she had acute onset 
dysarthria and CTA showed possible partial thrombus or stenosis 
in superior division of L MCA. Transferred here for closer 
monitoring and possible thrombectomy if her exam acutely 
worsens.

History obtained from patient and daughter at bedside. Patient 
is an excellent historian. 

On ___, she had dinner with friends and then returned to her 
apartment and was fooling around on her computer. Last known 
well
was around 8:00 ___. Then, she had an odd sensation and started 
throwing her arms around. She went to living room to sit down 
and
tried to read but could not see the words very clearly. Then, 
two family members were knocking at the door and she had a tough 
time
standing up to open door. She was able to eventually stand up 
with great difficulty and walked with her walker. She usually 
walks with a walker because of knee replacement. Finally, got up 
out of chair with walker and walked to the door to unlock. She 
noticed problems talking to family members. She had difficulty 
forming words and pronouncing words. Denies word finding 
difficulty. She could tell it was slurred like a person who had 
too much to drink. EMTs asked if she was intoxicated but she was 
not. She was very aware of her dysarthria and told her daughters 
that she thinks she's having a stroke. Then, she said she had 
trouble sitting down but has no idea why she thought that. When 
she was standing, she was able to walk with walker but she felt 
unsteady and almost fell. No visual changes. No numbness or 
tingling. Denies focal weakness; she just had trouble standing 
up. She was able to unlock her door without issue but she felt 
shaky. 

She was brought by EMS to ___ where NIHSS was 1 for 
slurred speech. There, she felt the same but her symptoms 
started to improve when she started to be transferred. 
Paramedics said her speech was improving rapidly en route.  

Last month, started needing naps. Her hearing is poor at 
baseline and she normally uses hearing aids. 

For the past ___ months, she has had ___ nocturia nightly. No 
dysuria. 

She has noticed more frequent headaches lately in the past ___ 
months. Last headache was yesterday. She takes tramadol and 
acetaminophen up to a couple times a night. She reports 
headaches at night which wake her up. She denies that the 
headache is
positional; it is the same sitting up or lying down. She has had 
some gradual weight loss over the past ~12 months; ___ year ago 
she was almost 140 lbs, and now she is ___ lbs. Her appetite is 
still good and she enjoys eating but she is less hungry that she 
used to be.  

Daughter says that she has had marked decline in memory in past 
___ weeks. Over past few years, she has been forgetting plans, 
times for pickpup, and dinner plans, which has become normal. 
Over the past ___ weeks, family has noticed dramatic worsening. 
She doesn't remember which grandkids were coming to visit when 
she bought the plane tickets herself.

She endorses 2 pillow orthopnea.

left ventricular systolic function in the setting of 
beat-to-beat variability due to arrhythmia. Mild to moderate 
mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Normal pulmonary pressure. 
Very small pericardial effusion
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with AFib on Eliquis, CHF, 
HLD, HTN who presented w/ sudden onset dysarthria, abnormal arm 
movements, and poor balance (walker at baseline). NIHSS 1 for 
slurred speech at OSH. There, a CTA head and neck was completed, 
and there was concern for left M2 branch attenuation concerning 
for stenosis or occlusion, and she was subsequently transferred 
for consideration of thrombectomy but NIHSS 0 on arrival so she 
was not deemed a candidate. She was admitted to the Neurology 
stroke service for further evaluation of possible TIA vs stroke. 
No further symptoms noted during admission. MRI head w/o 
contrast were without evidence of stroke. Reports recent 
echocardiogram per outpatient PCP/cardiologist, reported as no 
acute findings and so this was not repeated. She mentioned 
concern about worsening memory, but able to perform ADLs w/ 
meals/cleaning provided by ALF (moved 10 months ago); it appears 
there has been no acute change. She was taking apixiban 2.5mg 
once daily (unclear why as this is a BID medication), and so her 
dose was increased to 2.5mg BID (she was not a candidate for 5mg 
BID due to her age and weight). She was started on atorvastatin 
for her hyperlipidemia (LDL 126). EP cardiology was consulted 
for frequent sinus pauses noted on telemetry that persisted 
despite holding home atenolol, recommending discontinuing home 
digoxin and close cardiology ___. Discharged to home w/ 
___ & ___ and close PCP ___.

#Transient slurred speech and instability, c/f TIA
- ___ consult - cleared for home with home services
- Started on atorvastatin for HLD and increased home apixaban to 
therapeutic level
- ___ with stroke neurology after discharge

Her stroke risk factors include the following:
1) DM: A1c 5.5%
2) Likely chronic segmental left vertebral artery occlusion and 
somewhat small caliber attenuated left M2 inferior branch
3) Hyperlipidemia: LDL 126
4) Obesity
5) No concern noted for sleep apnea - she does not carry the 
diagnosis
An echocardiogram did not show a PFO on bubble study.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of slurred speech due to 
concern for an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a blood 
vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked by 
a clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms. However, the MRI of your brain did not show 
evidence of stroke or TIA. Your symptoms could have been related 
to blood pressure, dehydration, alcohol use, or a combination of 
these factors.

We are changing your medications as follows:
Increase apixaban to 2.5mg twice daily
Start Vitamin B12 daily supplement

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with your primary care physician as listed 
below. You should also follow up with your cardiologist as you 
were noted to have occasional pauses on cardiac monitoring.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, please pay attention to 
the sudden onset and persistence of these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o F w/ Hx of cervical CA s/p radical 
hysterectomy c/b chronic ___ lymphedema and urinary retention, 
Asthma, GERD, anxiety/depression, fibromyalgia. Please refer to 
the operative report for full details.

Her post-operative course was uncomplicated. Immediately 
post-op, her pain was controlled with IV dilaudid and toradol. 
However, in the PACU, the patient started feeling itchy.  Once 
the pt returned to the floor, she noted sensation of tongue / 
lip swelling, difficulty swallowing secretions, and a change in 
her voice.  No SOB, no flushing, no stridor or wheeze.  She was 
administered an Epi-pen, Solumedrol 100 mg IV, Famotidine 20 mg 
IV, and Hydroxyzine 25 mg IM.  She was transferred to the MICU 
for closer monitoring. 

The patient has numerous drug allergies and was administered the 
following medications intra-operatively: Midazolam, Rocuronium, 
Fentanyl, Dexamethasone, Hydromorphone, Ondansetron, Lidocaine, 
Propofol, Cefazolin, Glycopyrrolate, Phenylephrine, and 
Ketorolac.

In the MICU, initial VS were HR 87, BP 100/63, RR 17, S 100% 
___.  The patient was in NAD, without wheeze or poor air 
movement on exam, but complained of persistent voice change and 
difficulty swallowing, for which she required 2 more epi pens.  
Has remained hemodynamically stable and without respiratory 
compromise.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

*) Post operative care
Her pain was controlled immediately post-op with IV dilaudid and 
toradol. This was transitioned to po oxycodone as it was 
difficult to determine what was causing an allergic reaction in 
Ms. ___.

Her vaginal packing was removed on POD 1, on post-operative day 
2, her urine output was adequate and her Foley was removed. The 
patient was able to void spontaneously, but did require 
self-catheterization ___ times a day based on a sensation of 
bladder fullness. 

*) Anaphylaxis: 
In the PACU the patient awoke and started feeling pruritis. Once 
she arrived to the floor, the patient noted difficulty talking, 
subjectively swollen lips/tongue, and vocal changes. No SOB, no 
flushing, no stridor or wheeze. A trigger was called for 
anaphyllaxis and she recieved an Epi-pen, Solumedrol 100 mg IV, 
Famotidine 20 mg IV, and Hydroxyzine 25 mg IM.  She was 
transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring. 

In the MICU, initial VS were HR 87, BP 100/63, RR 17, S 100% 
___.  The patient was in NAD, without wheeze or poor air 
movement on exam, but complained of persistent voice change and 
difficulty swallowing, for which she required 2 more epi pens.  
Has remained hemodynamically stable and without respiratory 
compromise. 

Of note, patient was lying comfortable in bed around 2200 and 
continuing to inquire about more Epi-pens vs epinephrine gtt 
despite comfortable respiration, vocalization, non-edematous 
oral structures. She also perseverated about her Ativan and 
Ambien, as well as her propranolol for essential tremor despite 
explanation that beta blockers can worsen bronchoconstriction 
and respiratory compromise in anaphylaxis.

On the day she was called out to the floor, the pt complained of 
persistent facial flushing.  She was afebrile, hemodynamically 
stable, and without respiratory compromise or systemic symptoms. 
 Symptomatic care with hydroxyzine and eucerin lotion was 
provided.

Upon step down to the floor, the patient again reported to 
nursing that she felt throat constriction. Epinephrine and 
solumedrol were given and the patient felt relief. Allergy was 
consulted, and they asked us to stop all new medications given 
to her while at the hospital, and to report all of them as 
allergies. In addition, we sent out a tryptase level, as well as 
coordinated outpatient follow-up with them. 

#Chronic ___ edema: Continue home Metolazone, spironolactone, 
potassium repletion as not hypotensive.  We monitored her K 
during her stay, which was WNL.

#Asthma: Home Albuterol use ___ per week, did not require in 
the MICU. 

#GERD: Nexium (was initially held on admission, but per pt 
request was given on ___ prior to advancing diet)

#ADHD: On Adderall, held on admission

# Anxiety/depression/fibromyalgia: lorazepam 

# Insomnia: zolpidem

By post-operative day 1, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral 
medications. She was the  discharged home in stable condition 
with outpatient follow-up scheduled. She was also scheduled to 
have an appointment with Allergy and Immunology.

Chief Complaint:
Gait instability, multiple falls
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr ___ is a pleasant right handed ___ year old male with Afib, 
on coumadin, who is quite independent, living with his wife and 
was in a good state of health until mid last year. At that time 
his wife reports that he began having periods of disorganized 
speech and gait instability. He did not have a fall until 3 
months ago when he broke several ribs on his coffee table. He 
did not have any head trauma and was not scanned at an OSH. His 
garbled speech and unsteadiness have waxed and waned over the 
past 6 months and his wife reports that they are much improved 
when he takes his diuretics. Over this period he has lost ~20 
lbs. 
Last night he was sorting papers at the dining room table when 
he fell from standing because of the dizziness. He reports no 
LOC, no head trauma and was able to stand back up and continue 
his work. His wife placed him on the couch, but he got back up 
and fell in the bathroom - again he denies any LOC or head 
trauma, blaming his instability and ___ weakness. He had no 
tongue biting or loss of bowel/bladder continence. He went to 
bed last night, but the morning of presentation his wife was 
concerned about his falls and brought him to the ED. He does 
have a diagnosis of DM II from just over a month ago and has 
started oral hypoglycemics for which he reports having low ___ at 
home. He was seen by an outside neurologist the week prior who 
had ordered a CT head to be completed the following week. In the 
ED his head was scanned which revealed no bleed but a 3x3 L 
frontal lobe extra-axial mass with compressive effect but
no midline shift. Neurosurgery was contacted for evaluation of 
the mass and its possible role in the patient's recent symptoms.

CT Head ___: 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Extra-axial lesion, containing foci of calcifications 
measuring up to 3 cm, which likely reflects an extra-axial mass 
such as a meningioma. An 
extra-axial hematoma, which would be subacute to chronic, is 
considered less likely. 
2. Loss of gray-white differentiation in the high left 
frontoparietal lobe, could reflect an acute infarct. 

MRI Head ___:
Acute to subacute bilateral infarctions with the largest focus 
in the left post-central gyrus. Appearance of the post-gyrus 
lesion is somewhat 
heterogeneous however and recommend attention on followup 
imaging for further evaluation to exclude the presence of an 
underlying mass. Two meningiomas in the left frontal region 
without significant mass effect.

ECHO ___:
Marked symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function. Mild aortic valve 
stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Right ventricular free wall 
hypertrophy. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Dilated 
ascending aorta. 
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
The patient has mild aortic stenosis. Based on ___ ACC/AHA 
Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up echocardiogram is 
suggested in ___ years. 
Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical 
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on 
clinical and echocardiographic data. 

MRA Head/Neck ___:
Mild atherosclerotic disease of the basilar artery. There is no 
evidence of acute vascular abnormalities involving the 
intracranial arteries 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the neurosurgical service on ___ 
from the emergency room after having a series of falls on 
___. A CT of the head demonstrated a left frontal 
extra-axial mass as well as a more acute lesion in the parietal 
lobe on the left. Because of his recent falls, his coumadin was 
held and he was placed on an insulin sliding scale as there was 
some concern for hypoglycemia contributing to the unsteadiness. 

An MRI of this head was obtained which confirmed a meningioma 
overlying the L frontal lobe and a sub-acute infarct in the 
post-central gyrus on the left. While he did have distinct right 
sided weakness in the emergency room, on hospital day #2 this 
weakness had nearly completely resolved and his confusion was 
also better. A neurology consult was obtained given what 
appeared to be a sub-acute stroke on his MRI - they recommended 
restarting the pt's coumadin, holding the dilantin and checking 
an EEG, these were done while he was an inpatient. He also 
underwent a surface echo and an MRA of the brain and neck given 
the likely embolic nature of his strokes. 

Neurology will see him in 3 months with a repeat head MRI. 
___ also saw him for his diabetes managment 
and recommended changing his glipizide to 10 BID, and not 
starting insulin. His sugars were well controlled while in house 
and he did not have any episodes of hypoglycemia. From a 
neurologic standpoing, in-house he did quite well with resultion 
of his right sided weakness although his unsteadiness continued

General Instructions/Information
Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, 
or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain 
medicine can cause constipation. We generally recommend taking 
an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) 
while taking narcotic pain medication.

anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and 
Ibuprofen etc.  
 If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure 
you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, 
Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach 
irritation.  Make sure to take your steroid medication with 
meals, or a glass of milk. 
Clearance to drive and return to work will be addressed at your 
post-operative office visit.
Make sure to continue to use your incentive spirometer while

CXR ___: 1. Mild congestive heart failure.  
2. Widened superior mediastinum with leftward deviation of the 
trachea, similar when compared to the prior study. Findings may 
reflect the presence of a thyroid goiter, and clinical 
correlation is recommended, and if indicated, this could be 
confirmed with a CT of the chest.  
  
L-spine film ___: Five non-rib-bearing lumbar-type vertebral 
 
bodies are present. There are multilevel degenerative changes, 
with loss of intervertebral disc height at multiple levels, 
endplate sclerotic changes, and anterior osteophyte formation. 
There is no fracture or vertebral compression deformity 
identified. There is likely mild grade 1 L5 on S1 
anterolisthesis, which is likely degenerative in etiology. Facet 
hypertrophic changes are noted within the lower lumbar spine 
primarily affecting L3 through L5 levels. Vascular 
calcifications are visualized. The sacroiliac joints are not 
diastatic.  
IMPRESSION: No fracture identified.  

CT head ___:
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema or acute 
vascular 
territorial infarction. Note is made of areas of 
encephalomalacia involving the parietal lobe on the left, which 
appear unchanged as does an area of hypodensity on the right 
adjacent to the caudat.. Similarly unchanged are two left 
frontal meningiomas, the larger of which is partially calcified, 
and better depicted on the prior MRI (2:24, 601:19). Ventricles 
and sulci are enlarged, reflecting parenchymal volume loss. Note 
is made of atherosclerotic calcification at the carotid siphons 
bilaterally as well as of both V4 segments. There is no 
fracture. The mastoid air cells are clear. 
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality, and unchanged 
findings of 
previous infarcts and meningiomas. 

LENIs ___:
Waveforms in the common femoral veins are symmetric bilaterally 
with appropriate responses to Valsalva maneuvers. In both lower 
extremities, the common femoral, proximal greater saphenous, 
superficial femoral and popliteal veins are normal with 
appropriate compressibility, wall-to-wall flow on color Doppler 
analysis and response to waveform augmentation. Wall-to-wall 
flow is also visualized in the posterior tibial and peroneal 
veins of both calves.
IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity. 

  

MICROBIOLOGY: 
___: Blood culture - no growth to date

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with DM, afib, and CHF presenting with pulm edema and 
worsening ___ edema.
 
# CHF: Likely an acute on chronic worsening of diastolic 
congestive heart failure (most recent LVEF >55%) and recent 
decrease in mobility from fall. Ruled out for MI. Likely his 
worsening edema is due to medication non-compliance versus 
worsening of his aortic stenosis. His most recent echo is from 
___, and it was recommended this be repeated as an outpatient. 
He was never hypoxic, though lung exam suggested increased pulm 
edema. His legs were elevated and compression stockings were 
used. His torsemide was dosed at 10mg daily, though it's unclear 
if this was an increase from 5mg or the same dose, and the 
patient and wife were unable to clarify. There was slight 
improvement in swelling on discharge.
 
# RECENT FALLS: Patient reports falling twice recently at home 
and on a trip. He was evaluated by physical therapy, who felt he 
is unsteady on his feet but safe for discharge home with ___ and 
a walker/commode. The wife was instructed to maintain 24 hour 
care for him in the home to help prevent further falls. 

# ___: Cr up to 1.6 on admission. Improved to 1.3 the next day, 
likely closer to baseline. 
   
# DM: Glipizide and actos held while in hospital. Covered with 
an insulin sliding scale and oral medications restarted on 
discharge.
  
# HTN: Continued isosorbide and lisinopril (held for one day 
given ___. Metoprolol dose was lowered to 25mg TID given his 
bradycardia.

# Afib: INR was 2.9 on admission, and unclear if he had taken 
his daily coumadin dose. He was restarted at 2.5mg daily. His 
wife noted that he had been switched to alternate 1.25mg with 
2.5mg. He was discharged with home services to follow INRs.

protocol 
representing a fair exercise tolerance for her age; ~ ___ METS. 
The 
exercise test was stopped at the patient's request secondary to 
fatigue. 
During exercise, the patient reported a non-progressive, 
isolated upper 
left-sided chest discomfort; ___. The area of discomfort was 
reportedly 
tender to palpation. This discomfort resolved with rest and was 
absent 
2.5 minutes post-exercise. In the presence of the LBBB, the ST 
segments 
are uninterpretable for ischemia. The rhythm was sinus with 
frequent 
isolated APDs and occasional atrial couplets and atrial 
triplets. 
Resting mild systolic hypertension with normal blood pressure 
response 
to exercise. The heart rate response to exercise was mildly 
blunted. 
  
IMPRESSION: Fair exercise tolerance. No anginal symptoms with 
uninterpretable ECG to achieved workload. Resting mild systolic 
hypertension with appropriate blood pressure response to 
exercise. 
Suboptimal study - target heart rate not achieved. 
 
SIGNED:  ___ 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ ___ with several month history of left sided arm and chest 
wall pain in the setting of LBBB presenting for ___.  
.  
.  
# Chest Pain:The patient's symptoms were not typically anginal 
in nature to suggest ACS. However she does have several cardiac 
risk factors and a LBBB, so  physicians could  not r/oMI with 
EKG alone. Trop. results were negative x3. Stress Echo revealed 
new regional dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferior and 
inferolateral walls consistent with single vessel disease in the 
PDA distribution. A cardiology consult was obtained and they 
felt she could be managed medically. Patient was already on an 
aspirin, and a statin. Given history to suggest asthma B-blocker 
was contraindicated. She was discharged on 120 mg extended 
release diltiazem with instructions to follow up in cardiology 
and with her PCP. 
.
# Supraventricular tachycardia: The patient had multiple runs of 
SVT that was likley MAT in the setting of severe obstructive 
lung disease and chronic theophylline use. Cardiology 
reccomended that we discontinue her theophylline. We spoke with 
her pulmonologist who agreed this would be the best course of 
action for her. She was discharged with instructions to 
discontinue use of theophylline and follow up with her 
pulmonologist and cardiology.

echo done on ___, thought to be single vessel disease who 
presents with intermittent chest pain since her recent discharge 
on ___. During her recent hospitalization she was ruled out 
for an MI with three negative sets of cardiac enzymes, she had a 
stress echo which showed inducible ischemia at the achieved 
workload, thought to be single vessel disease per the echo 
report. At that time the plan was for medical management, given 
her severe underlying pulmonary disease she was not started on a

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with 
a recent diagnosis of CAD, HTN and asthma who presents with 
intermittent episodes of chest pain since her recent discharge.  

......................................
Active Issues:
.  
# CORONARIES: patient with intermittent episodes of left chest 
burning, that are not typical of angina since they resolve 
without intervention, are not relieved by nitro and have no 
association with exercise. However, given the findings on her 
recent stress echo of inducible ischemia it is concerning that 
her current symptoms could be related to her underlying CAD. Her 
troponins were negative during this hospital stay.  On this 
admission, she was started on Imdur 30 in addition to the 
medications started on last discharge as it was decided that she 
may need better medical management prior to resorting to PCI 
(which may be a possibility in the future). After administration 
of IMDUR, we walked the patient down the hall, as well as up 
several flights of stairs. She denied feeling short of breath, 
nor did she endorse any other cardiac symtpoms, such as chest 
pain. In fact, she stated that she felt well walking. 
.  
# RHYTHM: LBBB on EKG from yesterday, regular. patient with a 
new diagnosis of MAT on last admission. We continued her on 
Diltiazem. She had several episodes of MAT on tele, but was 
asymptomatic. Given frequent PAT, ___ of Hearts monitor was 
arranged for her on discharge to exclude the possibility that 
symptoms are due to a tachyarrhythmia. 
.............................................
Inactive Issues:
# Hypertension: continued home HCTZ and diltiazem..  
# Asthma:continued home medications.    
# GERD: continued home omeprazole  
.    
CODE: full code  
.....................................  
Transitional Issues:
1) Patient was started on Imdur 30mg daily in additon to her 
other medications. She is being medically managed for her 
coronary artery disease but may be a candidate for PCI in the 
future if the symtpoms of chest pain return.

ECHO stress test (___):  At the time of admission, her 
symptoms had resolved, no abnormalities were seen on imaging or 
labs, and her VS and PEx were remarkable only for non-acute lung 
findings.  MI was ruled out by trop negative x3, no EKG changes. 
 Cardiology was consulted to evaluate need for catheterization 
vs other intervention, but did not feel that any urgent 
inpatient work-up was necessary, especially in the context of 
asymptomatic tachycardia.  She had already had Holter and ECHO 
prior to this admission.  Cardiology recommended restarting 
theophylline if, in fact, she received such benefit from 
pulmonary point of view.  She was restarted on theophylline 
200mg TID, which was her dose prior to discontinuation.  She 
received tobacco cessation education, was continued on home 
diltiazem and aspirin (dose was temporarily increased to 325mg 
prior to ruling out MI).  Admission theopylline level was 
pending at the time of discharge.

nebs, and she was continued on her home doses of fluticasone, 
montelukast, fluticasone-salmetrol.  She was given O2 PRN.

at 200mg TID, with pulm and cardiology follow-up.

# Tobacco abuse: she declined nicotine patch, and education was 
given regarding the health hazards of smoking.

# HL: patient was continued oh her simvastatin, but because her 
LDL was not at goal (<70), her dose was increased to 40mg daily.
